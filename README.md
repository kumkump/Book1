Testing of customer management
Testing of order management, including processing and fulfilling orders
Testing of reporting and analytics
Deliverables:

Test plan: This document will outline the testing strategy, scope, and approach for the project.
Test cases: These are step-by-step instructions for executing tests on various features of OpenCart.
Test results: This document will include the results of each test case, including any issues found and their severity.
Bug reports: Any issues found during testing will be documented and reported to the development team for resolution.
Final report: This will summarize the overall testing results and provide recommendations for improving the software.
Testing Approach:

Functional testing: This will involve testing the various features and functionalities of OpenCart to ensure that they are working as expected.
Regression testing: This will involve re-testing previously tested features to ensure that they are still working after new changes or updates have been made.
Usability testing: This will involve testing the user-friendliness of the platform to ensure that it is easy to use and navigate.

Web browser testing tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools)
Bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla)
Test management tools (e.g., TestRail, Zephyr)
Testing Timeline:
The testing timeline will depend on the scope of the project, but typically it can take several weeks to complete. The timeline will be agreed upon with the project stakeholders before the testing phase begins.

Testing Team:
The testing team will consist of experienced manual testers who have expertise in eCommerce platforms and have an understanding of the business requirements of OpenCart.

Conclusion:
Manual testing of the OpenCart eCommerce platform is an important step in ensuring that it is of high quality and meets the business requirements of the users. The testing approach and tools used will be tailored to the specific needs of the project to ensure that it is completed on time and within budget. The deliverables will provide valuable information to the development team and project stakeholders to make informed decisions about the software.
